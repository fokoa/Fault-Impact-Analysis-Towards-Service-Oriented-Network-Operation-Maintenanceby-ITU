# Fault-Impact-Analysis-Towards-Service-Oriented-Network-Operation-Maintenanceby-ITU


## Problem statement

In order to better guide fault management and optimally allocate limited O&M resources, this problem is targeting at leveraging ML/AI to predict the impact of faults on RAN KPIs. This is a critical capability for the autonomy of next-generation communications systems. It will empower the state-of-the-art fault management to upgrade from fixing network devices to fixing network service quality, and eventually drive network O&M transformation from equipment-centric to service-centric.
